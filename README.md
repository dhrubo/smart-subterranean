# smart-subterranean

We want to turn our idea of extending houses into an open source project so others can get involved and contribute towards a standardised framework. 

We are a family of 4 in a 2 bedroom house in London. We can't afford to move but we need more living space. We would like to extend our current home in a sustainable way to bring us closer to nature and integrate better with our local environment and community. 

Our house is on a hill and the garden is two feet higher than our house. We want to build a subterranean level underneath our garden and keep our current garden as a garden possibly turn into something that grows and recycles more.

I have spoken to a few local developers and companies that specialise in subterranean basements, who have quoted us what would cost ridiculous amounts of money with designs that seem quite basic. 


We do not have endless budget nor am I interested in building a futuristic version of Microsoft's smart home. We want to modify our current home into an extendible living space using technology in a 'smart' modular way to help convert what he have already into something that's more environmentally friendly

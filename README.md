# smart-subterranean

We want to turn our idea of extending houses into an open source project so others can get involved and contribute towards a standardised framework. 

Background: We are a family of 4 in a 2 bedroom house in London. We can't afford to move but we need more living space. We need to extend our current living space but build this project in a smart sustainable way. 

Our house is on a hill and our garden is two feet higher than our house. We want to explore building a subterranean level underneath our garden and keep current garden as a living garden that turns into a something that grows, measures and recycles more. 

I have spoken to a few local developers and companies who specialise in subterranean basements but they have quoted us ridiculous amounts of money to do this right way. We don't have a lot of assets so we need to fund our project by borrowing more against our  house. I can't afford to hire the best architects or designers so I turn to you to seek some guidance as I genuinely believe there is a need  for families who live in London to have more space.
